# 👋 Hi, I'm Charalampos Panagopoulos

Aspiring Web Developer transitioning from theology and customer service into tech.  
I’m building strong front-end foundations, automating real problems with n8n, and running my own self-hosted homelab — all while working full-time in Greece.

I love solving problems with technology, creating structure in my learning, and building tools that make everyday life easier.

## 🧠 Currently Learning

- HTML, CSS, Flexbox, CSS Grid, Bootstrap  
- JavaScript Fundamentals (in progress)  
- Front-end best practices & responsive design

## 🛠️ What I’m Building

### **Self-Hosted Homelab (Linux, Docker, Tailscale)**
My personal infrastructure for development, automation, and learning:
- Dockerized services (Jellyfin, Nextcloud, Vaultwarden, etc.)
- Automated remote access using Tailscale
- Optimized workflows for study and productivity

### **n8n Automation Projects**
- 📚 **Image-to-Notes Learning System** (Nextcloud + OpenAI Vision)  
  Converts handwritten notes into structured digital cards  
- 🗓️ **AI-Powered Daily Scheduler** *(in development)*  
- ⚙️ Custom routines, productivity tools, and quality-of-life automations  

### **Front-End Projects**
- Personal portfolio website (HTML/CSS/Javascript only for now — growing over time)  
- Small practice projects to sharpen JavaScript and layout skills

## 🚀 What Drives Me

Technology helps me solve my own problems:
- When I needed structure while studying, I built automations.  
- When I wanted more control, I built and managed my homelab.  
- When the manual work became too much, I designed workflows to remove it.

This mindset keeps me learning, improving, and building every day.
